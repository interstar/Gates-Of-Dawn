Gates-Of-Dawn
=============

Python library for creating Pure Data patches.

== Why?

Pure Data is a great free synth making toolkit. But I've always found it too laborious to use in practice. I wanted to get into PD, but I think in code. I like my programmer-defined, reusable abstractions. When I'm defining a data-flow network I don't want to be messing around laying out each part in arbitrary x,y co-ordinates.

Gates-of-Dawn lets me write my PD patches as cleanly and succinctly as possible - using function composition - while laying the UI components out for me. Right now it only handles a small subset of PD objects. And is probably way too limited. But I'm already finding it pretty useful for putting synths together.

== How?

Look at example.py for a couple of monophonic FM synths.
